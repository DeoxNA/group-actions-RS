This folder stores temporary files which are created in the process of
running the program ../main.mag.

For each genus xx, there are three files which are created:
   gxxpossible_full
   gxxnotfull
   gxxfull

The first file stores data which does not satisfy one of the cases in
Theorem pg 390 of:

Ries, J. F. X. (1993). Subvarieties of moduli space determined by finite
groups acting on surfaces. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 335(1):385â€“406

but could satisfy one of the Tables in the paper. Meanwhile, any actions
which do satisfy one of the cases are written to gxxnotful, and any
actions which must correspond to full automorphism groups (for instance
if there are more than 4 branch points) are written to gxxfull. 

Once all data has been checked against the Theorem, those that do not
satisfy one of the conditions are checked against the Tables in the
above paper (by loading gxxpossible_full from the file main.mag), and
written to the appropriate of the latter two files.


The latter two files are then called from ../main.mag and they call
the functions in addl_data.mag for each entry.


Additionally, another file TBLDATA is created which records the examples
which satify one of the two tables in the paper above.
