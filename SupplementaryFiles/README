This folder stores supplementary files for the program ../main.mag.

There is a folder called "BreuerRaw" which contains one file named
gxx for each genus xx (currently from 02 to 10). Each file, when
loaded in Magma, creates a list Ldata and each entry in this list
is a pair consisting of a signature and group, corresponding to one
entry in Breuer's original data.


Additionally, during the execution of the functions in main.mag, a
file testingfull is created and stored here. This file is created by
the file ries.mag for each example which might satisfy the conditions
of Theorem pg. 390 in Ries' paper. It creates the group H (as at the
end of the Theorem) as a quotient group defined by a series of
relations and includes a call to the function PrintPossibleFullAuto,
also in ries.mag. The file is loaded into Magma by a command at the
end of the file ries.mag.
